SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management system. 
It is a tool that collects data from various endpoints/network devices across the network, stores them at a centralized place, 
and performs correlation on them. This room will cover the basic concepts required to understand SIEM and how it works.

1) Host-Centric Log Sources

These are log sources that capture events that occurred within or related to the host. Some log sources that generate host-centric logs are Windows Event logs, Sysmon, Osquery, etc. Some examples of host-centric logs are:

A user accessing a file
A user attempting to authenticate.
A process Execution Activity
A process adding/editing/deleting a registry key or value.
Powershell execution
2) Network-Centric Log Sources

Network-related logs are generated when the hosts communicate with each other or access the internet to visit a website. Some network-based protocols are SSH, VPN, HTTP/s, FTP, etc. Examples of such events are:

SSH connection
A file being accessed via FTP
Web traffic
A user accessing company's resources through VPN.
Network file sharing Activity
Importance of SIEM

Shows SOC CapabilitiesNow that we have covered various types of logs, it's time to understand the importance of SIEM. 
As all these devices generate hundreds of events per second, examining the imglogs on each device one by one in case of any incident can be a tedious task. 
That is one of the advantages of having a SIEM solution in place. It not only takes logs from various sources in real-time but also provides the ability to
correlate between events, search through the logs, investigate incidents and respond promptly. Some key features provided by SIEM are:

Real-time log Ingestion
Alerting against abnormal activities
24/7 Monitoring and visibility
Protection against the latest threats through early detection
Data Insights and visualization
Ability to investigate past incidents.

Linux Workstation

Linux OS stores all the related logs, such as events, errors, warnings, etc. Which are then ingested into SIEM for continuous monitoring. Some of the common locations where Linux store logs are:

/var/log/httpd : Contains HTTP Request  / Response and error logs.
/var/log/cron   : Events related to cron jobs are stored in this location.
/var/log/auth.log and /var/log/secure : Stores authentication related logs.
/var/log/kern : This file stores kernel related events.

Log IngestionShows Log Ingestion in SIEM

All these logs provide a wealth of information and can help in identifying security issues. Each SIEM solution has its own way of ingesting the logs. Some common methods used by these SIEM solutions are explained below:

1) Agent / Forwarder: These SIEM solutions provide a lightweight tool called an agent (forwarder by Splunk) that gets installed in the Endpoint. It is configured to capture all the important logs and send them to the SIEM server.

2) Syslog: Syslog is a widely used protocol to collect data from various systems like web servers, databases, etc., are sent real-time data to the centralized destination.
3) Manual Upload: Some SIEM solutions, like Splunk, ELK, etc., allow users to ingest offline data for quick analysis. Once the data is ingested, it is normalized and made available for analysis.

4) Port-Forwarding: SIEM solutions can also be configured to listen on a certain port, and then the endpoints forward the data to the SIEM instance on the listening port.

Splunk: 
is a platform for collecting, storing, and analysing machine data.
It provides various tools for analysing data, including search, correlation,
and visualisation. It is a powerful tool that organisations of all sizes can use to improve their IT operations and security posture.

ELK :
stands for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. These are three open-source tools that are commonly used together to collect, store, analyse, and visualise data.

SIEM Capabilities
SIEM is one major component of a Security Operations Center (SOC) ecosystem, as illustrated below. 
SIEM starts by collecting logs and examining if any event/flow has matched the condition set in the rule or crossed a certain threshold

Some of the common capabilities of SIEM are:

Correlation between events from different log sources.
Provide visibility on both Host-centric and Network-centric activities.
Allow analysts to investigate the latest threats and timely responses.
Hunt for threats that are not detected by the rules in plac


Use-Case 1:

Adversaries tend to remove the logs during the post-exploitation phase to remove their tracks. A unique Event ID 104 is logged every time a user tries to remove or clear event logs. To create a rule based on this activity, we can set the condition as follows:

Rule: If the Log source is WinEventLog AND EventID is 104 - Trigger an alert Event Log Cleared

Use-Case 2: Adversaries use commands like whoami after the exploitation/privilege escalation phase. The following Fields will be helpful to include in the rule.

Log source: Identify the log source capturing the event logs
Event ID: which Event ID is associated with Process Execution activity? In this case, event id 4688 will be helpful.
NewProcessName: which process name will be helpful to include in the rule?
Rule: If Log Source is WinEventLog AND EventCode is 4688, and NewProcessName contains whoami, then Trigger an ALERT WHOAMI command Execution DETECTED

In the previous task, the importance of field-value pairs was discussed. Correlation rules keep an eye on the values of certain fields to get triggered. That is the reason why it is important to have normalized logs ingested.

Alert Investigation

When monitoring SIEM, analysts spend most of their time on dashboards as it displays various key details about the network in a very summarized way. 
Once an alert is triggered, the events/flows associated with the alert are examined, and the rule is checked to see which conditions are met. Based on the investigation, 
the analyst determines if it's a True or False positive. Some of the actions that are performed after the analysis are:

Alert is False Alarm. It may require tuning the rule to avoid similar False positives from occurring again.
Alert is True Positive. Perform further investigation.
Contact the asset owner to inquire about the activity.
Suspicious activity is confirmed. Isolate the infected host.
Block the suspicious IP.
