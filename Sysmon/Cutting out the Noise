Filtering Events with PowerShell

To view and filter events with PowerShell we will be using Get-WinEvent along with XPath queries. We can use any XPath queries that can be found in the XML view of events. We will be using wevutil.exe to view events once filtered.
The command line is typically used over the Event Viewer GUI as it allows for further granular control and filtering whereas the GUI does not. For more information about using Get-WinEvent and wevutil.exe check out the Windows
Event Log room.


Filter by Event ID: */System/EventID=<ID>

Filter by XML Attribute/Name: */EventData/Data[@Name="<XML Attribute/Name>"]

Filter by Event Data: */EventData/Data=<Data>

We can put these filters together with various attributes and data to get the most control out of our logs. Look below for an example of using Get-WinEvent to look for network connections coming from port 4444.
Get-WinEvent -Path <Path to Log> -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=3 and */EventData/Data[@Name="DestinationPort"] and */EventData/Data=4444'

Q# How many event ID 3 events are in C:\Users\THM-Analyst\Desktop\Scenarios\Practice\Filtering.evtx?

We can also do that by usong Event Viewer 
PS C:\Users\THM-Analyst>  Get-WinEvent -Path C:\Users\THM-Analyst\Desktop\Scenarios\Practice\Filtering.evtx -FilterXPath '*/System/EventID=3' |Measure-Object


Count    : 73591
Average  :
Sum      :
Maximum  :
Minimum  :
Property :
