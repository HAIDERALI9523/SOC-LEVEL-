Persistence Overview

Persistence is used by attackers to maintain access to a machine once it is compromised. 
There is a multitude of ways for an attacker to gain persistence on a machine. 
We will be focusing on registry modification as well as startup scripts. 
We can hunt persistence with Sysmon by looking for File Creation events as well as Registry Modification events.
The SwiftOnSecurity configuration file does a good job of specifically targeting persistence and techniques used.
You can also filter by the Rule Names in order to get past the network noise and focus on anomalies within the event logs.
