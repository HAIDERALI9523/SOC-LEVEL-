Hunting Metasploit

Metasploit is a commonly used exploit framework for penetration testing and red team operations. Metasploit can be used to easily run exploits on a machine and connect back to a meterpreter shell. 
We will be hunting the meterpreter shell itself and the functionality it uses. To begin hunting we will look for network connections that originate from suspicious ports such as 4444 and 5555. 
By default, Metasploit uses port 4444. If there is a connection to any IP known or unknown it should be investigated. To start an investigation you can look at packet captures from the date of 
the log to begin looking for further information about the adversary. We can also look for suspicious processes created. This method of hunting can be applied to other various RATs and C2 beacons.
