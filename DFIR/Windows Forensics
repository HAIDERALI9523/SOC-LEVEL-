Windows Registry:

The Windows Registry is a collection of databases that contains the system's configuration data. This configuration data can be about the hardware, the software, or the user's information. It also includes data about the recently used files, programs used, or devices connected to the system. As you can understand, this data is beneficial from a forensics standpoint. Throughout this room, we will learn ways to read this data to identify the required information about the system. You can view the registry using regedit.exe, a built-in Windows utility to view and edit the registry. We'll explore other tools to learn about the registry in the upcoming tasks.

The Windows registry consists of Keys and Values. When you open the regedit.exe utility to view the registry, the folders you see are Registry Keys. Registry Values are the data stored in these Registry Keys. A Registry Hive is a group of Keys, subkeys, and values stored in a single file on the disk.

Structure of the Registry:

The registry on any Windows system contains the following five root keys:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER
HKEY_USERS
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG
You can view these keys when you open the regedit.exe utility. To open the registry editor, press the Windows key and the R key simultaneously. It will open a run prompt that looks like this:



In this prompt, type regedit.exe, and you will be greeted with the registry editor window. It will look something like this:



Here you can see the root keys in the left pane in a tree view that shows the included registry keys, and the values in the selected key are shown in the right pane. You can right-click on the value shown in the right pane and select properties to view the properties of this value.

Here is how Microsoft defines each of these root keys. For more detail and information about the following Windows registry keys, please visit Microsoft's documentation.

​
Folder/predefined key	Description
HKEY_CURRENT_USER	Contains the root of the configuration information for the user who is currently logged on. The user's folders, screen colors, and Control Panel settings are stored here. This information is associated with the user's profile. This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKCU.
HKEY_USERS	Contains all the actively loaded user profiles on the computer. HKEY_CURRENT_USER is a subkey of HKEY_USERS. HKEY_USERS is sometimes abbreviated as HKU.
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE	Contains configuration information particular to the computer (for any user). This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKLM.
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT	
Is a subkey of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software. The information that is stored here makes sure that the correct program opens when you open a file by using Windows Explorer. This key is sometimes abbreviated as HKCR.

Starting with Windows 2000, this information is stored under both the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and HKEY_CURRENT_USER keys. The HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes key contains default settings that can apply to all users on the local computer. The HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes key has settings that override the default settings and apply only to the interactive user.

The HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT key provides a view of the registry that merges the information from these two sources. HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT also provides this merged view for programs that are designed for earlier versions of Windows. To change the settings for the interactive user, changes must be made under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes instead of under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.

To change the default settings, changes must be made under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes .If you write keys to a key under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, the system stores the information under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes.

If you write values to a key under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, and the key already exists under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes, the system will store the information there instead of under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes.



If you are accessing a live system, you will be able to access the registry using regedit.exe, and you will be greeted with all of the standard root keys we learned about in the previous task. However, if you only have access to a disk image, you must know where the registry hives are located on the disk. The majority of these hives are located in the C:\Windows\System32\Config directory and are:

DEFAULT (mounted on HKEY_USERS\DEFAULT)
SAM (mounted on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM)
SECURITY (mounted on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Security)
SOFTWARE (mounted on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software)
SYSTEM (mounted on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System)
Hives containing user information:

Apart from these hives, two other hives containing user information can be found in the User profile directory. For Windows 7 and above, a user’s profile directory is located in C:\Users\<username>\ where the hives are:

NTUSER.DAT (mounted on HKEY_CURRENT_USER when a user logs in)
USRCLASS.DAT (mounted on HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\CLASSES)
The USRCLASS.DAT hive is located in the directory C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows. 



The NTUSER.DAT hive is located in the directory C:\Users\<username>\.


Remember that NTUSER.DAT and USRCLASS.DAT are hidden files.

The Amcache Hive:

Apart from these files, there is another very important hive called the AmCache hive. This hive is located in C:\Windows\AppCompat\Programs\Amcache.hve.
Windows creates this hive to save information on programs that were recently run on the system.

Transaction Logs and Backups:

Some other very vital sources of forensic data are the registry transaction logs and backups.
The transaction logs can be considered as the journal of the changelog of the registry hive. Windows often uses transaction logs when writing data to registry hives.
This means that the transaction logs can often have the latest changes in the registry that haven't made their way to the registry hives themselves. The transaction log for each hive is stored as a
.LOG file in the same directory as the hive itself. It has the same name as the registry hive, but the extension is .LOG. For example, the transaction log for the SAM hive will be located in C:\Windows\System32\Config 
in the filename SAM.LOG. Sometimes there can be multiple transaction logs as well. In that case, they will have .LOG1, .LOG2 etc., as their extension. It is prudent to look at the transaction logs as well when performing 
registry forensics.

Registry backups are the opposite of Transaction logs. These are the backups of the registry hives located in the C:\Windows\System32\Config directory.
These hives are copied to the C:\Windows\System32\Config\RegBack directory every ten days. It might be an excellent place to look if you suspect that some registry keys might have been deleted/modified recently.


Now that we have learned how to read registry data, let's find out where to look in the registry to perform our forensic analysis.

When we start performing forensic analysis, the first step is to find out about the system information. This task will cover gathering information related to a machine's System and Account information.

OS Version:

If we only have triage data to perform forensics, we can determine the OS version from which this data was pulled through the registry. To find the OS version, we can use the following registry key:

SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion

This is how Registry Explorer shows this registry key. Take a look and answer Question # 1.

    

Current control set:

The hives containing the machine’s configuration data used for controlling system startup are called Control Sets. Commonly, we will see two Control Sets, ControlSet001 and ControlSet002, in the SYSTEM hive on a machine. In most cases (but not always), ControlSet001 will point to the Control Set that the machine booted with, and ControlSet002 will be the last known good configuration. Their locations will be:

SYSTEM\ControlSet001

SYSTEM\ControlSet002

Windows creates a volatile Control Set when the machine is live, called the CurrentControlSet (HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet). For getting the most accurate system information, this is the hive that we will refer to. We can find out which Control Set is being used as the CurrentControlSet by looking at the following registry value:

SYSTEM\Select\Current

Similarly, the last known good configuration can be found using the following registry value:

SYSTEM\Select\LastKnownGood

This is how it looks like in Registry Explorer. Take a look and answer Question # 2.



It is vital to establish this information before moving forward with the analysis. As we will see, many forensic artifacts we collect will be collected from the Control Sets.

Computer Name:

It is crucial to establish the Computer Name while performing forensic analysis to ensure that we are working on the machine we are supposed to work on. We can find the Computer Name from the following location:

SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ComputerName\ComputerName 

Registry Explorer shows it like this. Take a look and answer Question # 3:



Time Zone Information:

For accuracy, it is important to establish what time zone the computer is located in. This will help us understand the chronology of the events as they happened. For finding the Time Zone Information, we can look at the following location:

SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\TimeZoneInformation

Here's how it looks in Registry Explorer. Take a look and answer Question # 4.



Time Zone Information is important because some data in the computer will have their timestamps in UTC/GMT and others in the local time zone. Knowledge of the local time zone helps in establishing a timeline when merging data from all the sources.

Network Interfaces and Past Networks:

The following registry key will give a list of network interfaces on the machine we are investigating:

SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces

﻿Take a look at this registry key as shown in Registry Explorer and answer Question # 5.




Each Interface is represented with a unique identifier (GUID) subkey, which contains values relating to the interface’s TCP/IP configuration. 
This key will provide us with information like IP addresses, DHCP IP address and Subnet Mask, DNS Servers, and more. This information is significant 
because it helps you make sure that you are performing forensics on the machine that you are supposed to perform it on.

The past networks a given machine was connected to can be found in the following locations:

SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\Signatures\Unmanaged

SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\Signatures\Managed



These registry keys contain past networks as well as the last time they were connected. The last write time of the registry key points to the last time these networks were connected.

Autostart Programs (Autoruns):

The following registry keys include information about programs or commands that run when a user logs on. 

NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\Explorer\Run

SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run



The following registry key contains information about services:

SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services

Notice the Value of the Start key in the screenshot below.



In this registry key, if the start key is set to 0x02, this means that this service will start at boot.

SAM hive and user information:

The SAM hive contains user account information, login information, and group information. This information is mainly located in the following location:

SAM\Domains\Account\Users

Registry Explorer allows us to sort data contained in registry keys quickly. For example, the Recent documents tab arranges the Most Recently Used (MRU) file at the top of the list. Registry Explorer also arranges them so that the Most Recently Used (MRU) file is shown at the top of the list and the older ones later.

Another interesting piece of information in this registry key is that there are different keys with file extensions, such as .pdf, .jpg, .docx etc. These keys provide us with information about the last used files of a specific file extension. So if we are looking specifically for the last used PDF files, we can look at the following registry key:

NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RecentDocs\.pdf

Registry Explorer also lists the Last Opened time of the files. Answer Question # 1 by looking at the above screenshot.

Office Recent Files:
Similar to the Recent Docs maintained by Windows Explorer, Microsoft Office also maintains a list of recently opened documents. This list is also located in the NTUSER hive. It can be found in the following location:

NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Office\VERSION

The version number for each Microsoft Office release is different. An example registry key will look like this:

NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Word

Here, the 15.0 refers to Office 2013. A list of different Office releases and their version numbers can be found on this link.

Starting from Office 365, Microsoft now ties the location to the user's live ID. In such a scenario, the recent files can be found at the following location. 

NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Office\VERSION\UserMRU\LiveID_####\FileMRU

In such a scenario, the recent files can be found at the following location. This location also saves the complete path of the most recently used files.

ShellBags:
When any user opens a folder, it opens in a specific layout. Users can change this layout according to their preferences. These layouts can be different for different folders. This information about the Windows 'shell' is stored and can identify the Most Recently Used files and folders. Since this setting is different for each user, it is located in the user hives. We can find this information on the following locations:

USRCLASS.DAT\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\Bags

USRCLASS.DAT\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\BagMRU

NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\BagMRU

NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\Bags

Registry Explorer doesn't give us much information about ShellBags. However, another tool from Eric Zimmerman's tools called the ShellBag Explorer shows us the information in an easy-to-use format. We just have to point to the hive file we have extracted, and it parses the data and shows us the results. An example is shown below. Take a look and answer Question # 2.



Open/Save and LastVisited Dialog MRUs:
When we open or save a file, a dialog box appears asking us where to save or open that file from. It might be noticed that once we open/save a file at a specific location, Windows remembers that location. This implies that we can find out recently used files if we get our hands on this information. We can do so by examining the following registry keys

NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ComDlg32\OpenSavePIDlMRU
NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ComDlg32\LastVisitedPidlMRU

This is how Registry Explorer shows this registry key. Take a look to answer Question # 3 and 4.



Windows Explorer Address/Search Bars:
Another way to identify a user's recent activity is by looking at the paths typed in the Windows Explorer address bar or searches performed using the following registry keys, respectively.

NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\TypedPaths

NTUSER.DAT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\WordWheelQuery

Here is how the TypedPaths key looks like in Registry Explorer:


A storage device in a computer system, for example, a hard disk drive or a USB device, is just a collection of bits. To convert these bits into meaningful information, they need to be organized. For this purpose, computer scientists and engineers have created different file systems that organize the bits in a hard drive as per a standard, so that information stored in these bits can be interpreted easily.

The File Allocation Table (FAT):
The File Allocation Table (FAT) is one of these file systems. It has been the default file system for Microsoft Operating Systems since at least the late 1970s and is still in use, though not the default anymore. As the name suggests, the File Allocation Table creates a table that indexes the location of bits that are allocated to different files. If you are interested in the history of the FAT file system, you can head to the Wikipedia page for it.

Data structures of the FAT file system:
The FAT file system supports the following Data structures:

Clusters:
A cluster is a basic storage unit of the FAT file system. Each file stored on a storage device can be considered a group of clusters containing bits of information.

Directory:
A directory contains information about file identification, like file name, starting cluster, and filename length.

File Allocation Table:
The File Allocation Table is a linked list of all the clusters. It contains the status of the cluster and the pointer to the next cluster in the chain.

In summary, the bits that make up a file are stored in clusters. All the filenames on a file system, their starting clusters, and their lengths are stored in directories. And the location of each cluster on the disk is stored in the File Allocation Table. We can see that we started with a raw disk composed of bits and organized it to define what group of bits refers to what file stored on the disk.

The exFAT file system:
As the file sizes have grown, especially with higher resolution images and videos being supported by the newer digital cameras, the maximum file size limit of FAT32 became 
a substantial limiting factor for camera manufacturers. Though Microsoft had moved on to the NTFS file system, it was not suitable for digital media devices as they did not 
need the added security features and the overhead that came with it. Therefore, these manufacturers lobbied Microsoft to create the exFAT file system.

The exFAT file system is now the default for SD cards larger than 32GB. It has also been adopted widely by most manufacturers of digital devices.
The exFAT file system supports a cluster size of 4KB to 32MB. It has a maximum file size and a maximum volume size of 128PB (Petabytes). It also reduces 
some of the overheads of the FAT file system to make it lighter and more efficient. It can have a maximum of 2,796,202 files per directory.


The NTFS file system
As observed in the previous task, the FAT file system is a very basic file system. It does the job when it comes to organizing our data, but it offers little more in terms of security, reliability, and recovery capabilities. It also has certain limitations when it comes to file and volume sizes. Hence, Microsoft developed a newer file system called the New Technology File System (NTFS) to add these features. This file system was introduced in 1993 with the Windows NT 3.1. However, it became mainstream since Windows XP. The NTFS file system resolves many issues present in the FAT file system and introduces a lot of new features. We will discuss some of the features below.

Journaling
The NTFS file system keeps a log of changes to the metadata in the volume. This feature helps the system recover from a crash or data movement due to defragmentation. This log is stored in $LOGFILE in the volume's root directory. Hence the NTFS file system is called a journaling file system.

Access Controls
The FAT file system did not have access controls based on the user. The NTFS file system has access controls that define the owner of a file/directory and permissions for each user.

Volume Shadow Copy
The NTFS file system keeps track of changes made to a file using a feature called Volume Shadow Copies. Using this feature, a user can restore previous file versions for recovery or system restore. In recent ransomware attacks, ransomware actors have been noted to delete the shadow copies on a victim's file systems to prevent them from recovering their data.

Alternate Data Streams
A file is a stream of data organized in a file system. Alternate data streams (ADS) is a feature in NTFS that allows files to have multiple streams of data stored in a single file. Internet Explorer and other browsers use Alternate Data Streams to identify files downloaded from the internet (using the ADS Zone Identifier). Malware has also been observed to hide their code in ADS.

Master File Table
Like the File Allocation Table, there is a Master File Table in NTFS. However, the Master File Table, or MFT, is much more extensive than the File Allocation Table. It is a structured database that tracks the objects stored in a volume. Therefore, we can say that the NTFS file system data is organized in the Master File Table. From a forensics point of view, the following are some of the critical files in the MFT:

$MFT
The $MFT is the first record in the volume. The Volume Boot Record (VBR) points to the cluster where it is located. $MFT stores information about the clusters where all other objects present on the volume are located. This file contains a directory of all the files present on the volume.

$LOGFILE
The $LOGFILE stores the transactional logging of the file system. It helps maintain the integrity of the file system in the event of a crash.

$UsnJrnl
It stands for the Update Sequence Number (USN) Journal. It is present in the $Extend record. It contains information about all the files that were changed in the file system and the reason for the change. It is also called the change journal.

MFT Explorer
MFT Explorer is one of Eric Zimmerman's tools used to explore MFT files. It is available in both command line and GUI versions. We will be using the CLI version for this task.

Start the machine attached with the task. It will open in the split view. If preferred, login to the machine through RDP using the following credentials:


MFTECmd.exe -f <path-to-$MFT-file> --csv <path-to-save-results-in-csv>

MFTECmd.exe



C:\Users\THM-4n6\Desktop\EZtools>MFTECmd.exe -f C:\Users\THM-4n6\Desktop\triage\C\$Boot --csv C:\Users\THM-4n6\Desktop




Windows Prefetch files
When a program is run in Windows, it stores its information for future use. This stored information is used to load the program quickly in case of frequent use. This information is stored in prefetch files which are located in the C:\Windows\Prefetch directory.

un Prefetch Parser on a file and save the results in a CSV, we can use the following command:

PECmd.exe -f <path-to-Prefetch-files> --csv <path-to-save-csv>

Similarly, for parsing a whole directory, we can use the following command:
PECmd.exe -d <path-to-Prefetch-directory> --csv <path-to-save-csv>

We can use this information to answer the questions at the end.

Windows 10 Timeline
Windows 10 stores recently used applications and files in an SQLite database called the Windows 10 Timeline. This data can be a source of information about the last executed programs. It contains the application that was executed and the focus time of the application. The Windows 10 timeline can be found at the following location:

C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\ConnectedDevicesPlatform\{randomfolder}\ActivitiesCache.db

We can use Eric Zimmerman's WxTCmd.exe for parsing Windows 10 Timeline. We get the following options when we run it:
We can use the following command to run WxTCmd:

WxTCmd.exe -f <path-to-timeline-file> --csv <path-to-save-csv>


Windows Jump Lists
Windows introduced jump lists to help users go directly to their recently used files from the taskbar. We can view jumplists by right-clicking an application's icon in the taskbar, and it will show us the recently opened files in that application. This data is stored in the following directory:

C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations

Jumplists include information about the applications executed, first time of execution, and last time of execution of the application against an AppID.

We can use Eric Zimmerman's JLECmd.exe to parse Jump Lists. We get the following options when we run it:
JLECmd.exe -f <path-to-Jumplist-file> --csv <path-to-save-csv>

In the folder named triage, present on the Desktop of the attached machine, we have extracted the Windows directory of a system we want to investigate. It retains the directory structure of the original Windows directory, that is, C:\Windows directory from the system is mapped on to C:\users\thm-4n6\Desktop\triage\C\Windows. Now let's use the information we have learned to perform analysis on the data saved in the folder named triage on the Desktop in the attached VM and answer the following questions.

If you are having trouble viewing the CSV file, you can use EZviewer from the EZtools folder.

Shortcut Files
Windows creates a shortcut file for each file opened either locally or remotely. The shortcut files contain information about the first and last opened times of the file and the path of the opened file, along with some other data. Shortcut files can be found in the following locations:

C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\

C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Office\Recent\

We can use Eric Zimmerman's LECmd.exe (Lnk Explorer) to parse Shortcut files. When we run the LECmd.exe, we see the following options:
