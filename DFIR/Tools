Many tools can aid a security analyst or incident responder in performing memory analysis on a potentially compromised endpoint.
One of the most popular tools is Volatility, which will allow an analyst to dig deep into the weeds when examining memory artifacts from an endpoint.
But this process can take time. Often, when an analyst is triaging, time is of the essence, and the analyst needs to perform a quick assessment to determine the nature of a security event.



That is where the FireEye tool Redline comes in. Redline will essentially give an analyst a 30,000-foot view (10 kilometers high view) of a Windows, Linux, or macOS endpoint. Using Redline, 
you can analyze a potentially compromised endpoint through the memory dump, including various file structures. With a nice-looking GUI (Graphical User Interface) - you can easily find the
signs of malicious activities. 



Here is what you can do using Redline:

Collect registry data (Windows hosts only)
Collect running processes
Collect memory images (before Windows 10)
Collect Browser History
Look for suspicious strings
And much more!

Standard Collector - this method configures the script to gather a minimum amount of data for the analysis. This is going to be our preferred method to collect data in this room. It is also usually the fastest method to collect the data you need. 
It takes only a few minutes to complete.


Comprehensive Collector - this method configures the script to gather the most data from your host for further analysis. This method takes up to an hour or more. 
You will choose this method if you prefer the full analysis of the system.

IOC Search Collector (Windows only) - this method collects data that matches with the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) that you created with the help of IOC Editor
. You will choose this method if you want to run the data collection against known IOCs that you have gathered either through threat intelligence (data feed or narrative report), 
incident response, or malware analysis. You imported them into IOC Editor. We'll look at the IOC Editor a bit further in the next task.


System Information: this is where you will see the information about the machine, BIOS (Windows only), operating system, and user information.
Processes: processes will contain different attributes such as Process Name, PID, Path, Arguments, Parent process, Username, etc. When you expand the Processes tab, there will be four sections: Handles, Memory Sections, Strings, and Ports.
A handle is a connection from a process to an object or resource in a Windows operating system. Operating systems use handles for referencing internal objects like files, registry keys, resources, etc.

Memory Sections will let you investigate unsigned memory sections used by some processes. Many processes usually use legitimate dynamic link libraries (DLLs), which will be signed. This is particularly interesting because if you see any unsigned DLLs then it will be worth taking a closer look. 

Strings - you will see the information on the captured strings.

Ports - this is one of the critical sections to pay attention to. Most malware often initiates the outbound or inbound connections to communicate to their command and control server (C2) to do some malicious activities like exfiltrating the data or grabbing a payload to the machine. This situation is where you can review the suspicious connections from ports and IP addresses. Pay attention to the system processes as well. The threat actors like to avoid detection by hiding under the system processes. For example, explorer.exe or notepad.exe shouldn't be on the list of processes with outbound connections. 

Some of the other important sections you need to pay attention to are:

File System (not included in this analysis session)
Registry
Windows Services
Tasks (Threat actors like to create scheduled tasks for persistence)
Event Logs (this another great place to look for the suspicious Windows PowerShell events as well as the Logon/Logoff, user creation events, and others)
ARP and Route Entries (not included in this analysis session)
Browser URL History (not included in this analysis session)
File Download History

The Timeline will help you to better understand when the compromise happened and what steps the malicious actor took to escalate the attack. The Timeline will also record every action on
the file if it got create, changed, modified, accessed. 



﻿Introduction to KAPE:
Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor (KAPE) parses and extracts Windows forensics artifacts. It is a tool that can significantly reduce the time needed to respond to an incident by providing forensic artifacts from a live system or a storage device much earlier than the imaging process completes. 

KAPE serves two primary purposes, 1) collect files and 2) process the collected files as per the provided options. For achieving these purposes, KAPE uses the concept of targets and modules. Targets can be defined as the forensic artifacts that need to be collected. Modules are programs that
process the collected artifacts and extract information from them. We will learn about them in the upcoming tasks.

How it works
KAPE is extensible and highly configurable. In essence, the KAPE binary ﻿ collects files and processes them as per the provided configuration.

The collection of files (targets) KAPE adds the files to a queue and copies them in two passes. In the first pass, it copies the files that it can. This works for files that the OS has not 
locked. The rest of the files are passed to a secondary queue. The secondary queue is processed using a different technique that uses raw disk reads to bypass the OS locks and copy the files.
The copied files are saved with original timestamps and metadata and stored in a similar directory structure. 

Once the data is collected, KAPE can process it using modules. The modules can be independent binaries that run on the collected data and process them to extract information. For example,
KAPE will collect and copy the Prefetch file to our target destination during the target collection. Running a Prefetch Parser (PECmd) module on this target will extract the prefetch file
and save it in a CSV fil

Compound Targets:
﻿KAPE also supports Compound Targets. These are Targets that are compounds of multiple other targets. As mentioned in the previous tasks, KAPE is often used for quick triage collection
and analysis. The purpose of KAPE will not be fulfilled if we have to collect each artifact individually. Therefore, Compound Targets help us collect multiple targets by giving a single c
ommand. Examples of Compound Targets include !BasicCollection, !SANS_triage and KAPEtriage. We can view the Compound Targets on the path KAPE\Targets\Compound. The following image shows what
a Compound Target for evidence of execution looks like:
