Created in 2015, Wazuh is an open-source, freely available and extensive EDR solution.
It can be used in all scales of environments. Wazuh operates on a management and agent module.
Simply, a device is dedicated to running Wazuh named a manager, where Wazuh operates on a management
and agent model where the manager is responsible for managing agents installed on the devices you’d like to monitor.


Devices that record the events and processes of a system are called agents.
Agents monitor the processes and events that take place on the device, such as authentication and user management. 
Agents will offload these logs to a designated collector for processing, such as Wazuh.

In order for Wazuh to be populated, agents need to be installed onto devices to log such events. Wazuh can guide you through the agent deployment process provided you fill out some pre-requisites such as::

Operating System
The address of the Wazuh server that the agent should send logs to (this can be a DNS entry or an IP address)
What group the agent will be under - you can sort agents into groups within Wazuh if you wish
This wizard can be launched by navigating to the following location on the Wazuh server: Wazuh -> Agents -> Deploy New Agent 


Wazuh’s Vulnerability Assessment module is a powerful tool that can be used to periodically scan an agent's operating system for installed applications and their version numbers.
Once this information has been gathered, it is sent back to the Wazuh server and compared against a database of CVEs to discover potential vulnerabilities.
For example, the agent in the screenshot below has a version of Vim that is vulnerable to CVE-2019-12735.

Wazuh is capable of auditing and monitoring an agent's configuration whilst proactively recording event logs. When the Wazuh agent is installed,
an audit is performed where a metric is given using multiple frameworks and legislations such as NIST, MITRE and GDPR.
